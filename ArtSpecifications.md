# Weapon Sprites
* Maximum size of 16x16
* The weapon barrel should be aligned along the horizontal axis
* Four sprites are required
  * Weapon_SIDE
  * Weapon_TOP
  * Weapon_UI
  * Weapon_GROUND
* The side view and top view must have the barrel end in the exact same horizontal position. To achieve this it is necessary to have the same canvas size. Preferably, this barrel end will be centered on the vertical axis in the 16x16 canvas
* The UI sprite should have the body of the weapon centered in the canvas.
* The Ground sprite should be identical to the UI sprite except have a white border around it
  * If the canvas size must be extended to 18x18 to achieve this that's okay
* The naming convention is as listed above with the word weapon replaced with the weapon's name

Below are examples with an AK-47. Note the differences may be difficult to see. I encourage you to download these and inspect the differences in an image editor.
