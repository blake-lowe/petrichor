Unity Project: 2D Cyberpunk Heisting Game

# How to set up development environment
1. Download Unity 2019.3.6.f1 using the Unity Hub
2. Clone the github repo into the folder you want your unity project to be in (you can use Github Desktop File->Clone Repository or you can download zip from github website)
3. In the project tab of Unity Hub click "ADD" and select the folder you cloned into
4. Check that the version is correct
5. Open the project by clicking on the project name
6. Wait like a billion years for everything to import

# Contributing to the project (using Github Desktop)
I use github desktop but feel free to use the command line interface if you want.
If you didn't clone the repo through github desktop then you can add it now by doing File->Add Local Repository.
Pull any changes before pushing your own and add informative summaries to your commits.

# Editing C# scripts
I use Rider which costs money but you can get it free as student through the IntelliJ website. Alternatives include Visual Studio and literally any text editor. Just make sure to set your preferred editor in Edit->Preferences->External Tools->External Script Editor.
